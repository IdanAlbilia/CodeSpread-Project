Project overview:
* In general the project was challenging, i wasn't too familiar with React, Redux before this assignment, nevertheless I tried to manage and complete most of the project goals.
* I didnt pay too much attention to the design because i figured it wasn't as important as the logic of the task..
* I didnt manage to get Redux to fully work although I did learn the fundamentals of the library, wrote some reducers and actions. I am positive that with a few more hours of work specifically on this problem i could have solved it.
* I did get to learn a lot from the task - React Hooks, Redux.
